## BEVO IAQ Fabrication Video

Nearly done with a revised draft - had some issues with transparent background that I wanted to address.

* Included more references
* Changed flow slightly

## Fitbit Sleep and Activity

See notebook [here](https://github.com/intelligent-environments-lab/utx000/blob/master/notebooks/4.2.3-hef-fitbit-activity_and_sleep.ipynb).

## Other Updates
* **After Effects**: Learning more about how to use After Effects for better quality videos/animations
* **SDHC**: 7 teams have registered and I am trying to squeeze in one more team. Currently working on finding judges.

## Future Work
* **PCA**: Will meet with Peter W. to learn more
* **Graduate Research Symposium**: Will start brainstorming the layout and results to use for my presentation
* **ASHRAE IAQ Paper**: Will start to condense what I have written into this format - **DUE: April 19th**

## Additional Questions
