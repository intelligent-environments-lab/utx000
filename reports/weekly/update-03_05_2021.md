# Weekly Update - March 5th 2021
This past week, I focused on:
1. Incorporating new Fitbit data into analysis/paper
2. Continuing to probe the relationship between UTx000 variables and Fitbit sleep
3. Organizing SDHC trainings and trying to increase participation
5. Other Updates
6. Future Work

## More Fitbit Data
I incorporated the Fitbit data from Cameron's ULG study. This helped provide:
* 4 additional participants
* 300+ additional nights of data

With this data, I was able to complete the Results subsections in the paper I am writing about sleep measurements from Fitbit, EMAs, and the combined dataset. The summary of data availability is shown below.

| Modality | Number of Nights | Number of Participants |
| :-: | :-: | :-: |
| Fitbit | 2859 | 54 |
| Beiwe | 2470 | 62 |
|Combined| 1060 | 46 |

## IEQ and Sleep
There were a few tasks related to my analysis that I wanted to address this week:
1. Understand Mutual Information (MI) better
2. Remove _low_ changes in nightly concentration and see effects
3. Process "environmentally relevant" responses from the first REDCap Environment and Experiences (EE) Survey
4. Consider subsets of air pollution profiles based on EE results
5. Use aspects of the EE Survey as a means to group participants

### Mutual Information
I wrote up a few paragraphs in paper about MI, but in general "Mutual information (MI) quantifies the amount of information or reduction in uncertainty from one random variable given knowledge of another." To test the efficacy of this idea, I compared various sleep metrics to each other with the following results:

<img src=https://github.com/intelligent-environments-lab/utx000/blob/master/reports/misc/mi_example.png>

MI was able to identify the nonlinear and linear relationships between `rem2nrem_minutes` and `light_percent` to `rem_percent`, respectively. 

### Nights with Changes in Concentration
One of the summary statistics I calculate for each night is the difference between the minimum and maximum pollutant concentration. I noticed that there were a lot of instances when the difference was ~0 so I removed these nights from the IEQ dataset and reconducted my analysis on IEQ parameters and sleep quality metrics from Fitbit. 

The summary of results include(s):
* :x: The relationship between IEQ and sleep quality got worse when I removed these nights.

### Processing EE Survey
I incorporated some survey responses into my analysis to help group my data into subsets based on the following:
* `building_type`: apartment, house, and other were the only responses given
* `window_use`: responses included to get fresh air, change temperature, both, and none
* `smell`: there were quite a few options but smell should be linked to some aspect of air quality, right?
* `cleaner_use`: in light of COVID, we asked participants about what cleaner(s) (i.e. bleach, vinegar, soap and water, etc.) that they used
* `allergy_intensity`: how bad the participants' allergies were the past week

### Relationships between IEQ and EE Survey
I wanted to first see how the person's environment might have shaped their exposure to different pollutant profiles that we measured. 

The summary of results includes:
* :x: `smell`:`cooking` and `pm2p5_number`
* :heavy_check_mark: `cleaner_use`:`alcohol` and `tvoc`
* :heavy_check_mark: `window_use`:`fresh_air` and `co2`
* :heavy_check_mark: `smell`:`well_ventilated`; `smell`:`stagnant` and `co2`

Figures for some of the positive relationships are shown below:

<img src=https://github.com/intelligent-environments-lab/utx000/blob/master/reports/figures/beacon_redcap/redcap-beacon_cleaner_use-tvoc_joyplot.png>

There appears to be a bi-modal distribution of TVOC concentrations for individuals that reported using `alcohol` to clean their dwelling. Since the TVOC sensors are very sensitive to ethanol, this overall increase in concentration makes sense.

<img src=https://github.com/intelligent-environments-lab/utx000/blob/master/reports/figures/beacon_redcap/redcap-beacon_smell-co2_joyplot.png>

There appear to be two relationships apparent from the joyplot: (1) a `stagnant` smell and `co2` and (2) a `well-ventilated` smell and `co2`. for the respondents who reported a `stagnant` smell, there are elevated concentrations near 4000 ppm whereas for individuals who said their apartment was `well_ventilated` it looks like more of their concentrations are centered around the 400 ppm concentration. 

### Sleep Analysis Based on EE Groups
I didn't dive into this too much because I couldn't see anything that was going to _considerably_ alter the outcome of any of my previous sleep analysis. Looking at building types was an easy analysis to do, so that is the one way I grouped my participants.
> Are there any characteristics of the participants/their environments that I could use?

The summary of results includes:
* :x: `building_type` and sleep metrics

## SDHC
Still plugging away at the Sustainable Dog House Challenge. As of writing this, we have two teams and the registration dealine is **today**. 

### Training Sessions
I coordinated with Prof. Brooks and his TA to host a SketchUp and Rhino training session, respectively. From these two events I will:
- [x] include a page on the Github Wiki about accessing remote desktops - might be useful for other classes
- [ ] process/edit the zoom recordings and post them on the Github Wiki for those who could not attend

### Promotion
Adele suggested created an Interest Form so people without teams could find me and then I could find them a team. So far we have connected one person with another.
> Any last-minute promotion ideas? 

## Other Updates
Below are listed some other, minor updates:

* **New VPN for Beacons**: I transitioned two of the beacons I had with me over to the new VPN and everything seems to work well. 
* **Beacon Software Update** Calvin is going to work on updating the software on the beacon to make it more reliable and digestible. 
* **GsAB Recruitment**: I created the gather.town space for recruitment purposes later today. Took longer than I anticipated but happy with the way it turned out! 
* **Graduate Student Symposium**: I registered for a talk at the symposium and am the only representative from BEE. As it stands I will be the first to present on Wednesday March 31st at 10:30 am. 
* **ASHRAE Indoor Air Conference**: The paper I am working on now can be easily adapted to this conference since it is based on the same abstract that I submitted :greece:
* **Faculty Recruitment**: Saw the candidates presentation and met with him during the student meeting. I will miss the MADS meeting on Monday again for faculty recruitment. This MADS meeting will be the last I miss for faculty recruitment purposes. 

## Future Work
The next steps in my analysis on IEQ and Sleep
* Identify key groups for various features i.e. activity level, low/high pollutant concentration profiles
* Develop code to run T-Test of differences amongst groups developed in the first point
* Anaylze the relationship between various features and sleep quality on a _per participant_ basis

> Any other future analysis that I should consider at this point?

I also plan to work on the Beacon Fabrication video again when I get tired of looking at data. 

## Additional Questions
For Zoltan:
> Status of Hamachi?

> Status of pololu.com order?

For Kerry:
> Any updates from MADS?
