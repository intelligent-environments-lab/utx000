# Weekly Update - March 5th 2021
This past week, I focused on:
1. Incorporating new Fitbit data into analysis/paper
2. Continuing to probe the relationship between UTx000 variables and Fitbit sleep
3. Organizing SDHC trainings and trying to increase participation
4. Designing the GsAB recruitment space

## More Fitbit Data
I incorporated the Fitbit data from Cameron's ULG study. This helped provide:
* 4 additional participants
* 300+ additional nights of data

With this data, I was able to complete the Results subsections in the paper I am writing about sleep measurements from Fitbit, EMAs, and the combined dataset. The summary of data availability is shown below.

| Modality | Number of Nights | Number of Participants |
| :-: | :-: | :-: |
| Fitbit | 2859 | 54 |
| Beiwe | 2470 | 62 |
|Combined| 1060 | 46 |

## IEQ and Sleep
There were a few tasks related to my analysis that I wanted to address this week:
1. Understand Mutual Information (MI) better
2. Process "environmentally relevant" responses from the first REDCap Environment and Experiences (EE) Survey
3. Use aspects of the EE Survey as a means to group participants

### Mutual Information
I wrote up a few paragraphs in paper about MI, but in general "Mutual information (MI) quantifies the amount of information or reduction in uncertainty from one random variable given knowledge of another." To test the efficacy of this idea, I compared various sleep metrics to each other with the following results:

MI was able to identify the nonlinear and linear relationships between `rem2nrem_minutes` and `light_percent` to `rem_percent`, respectively. 

### Processing EE Survey
I incorporated some survey responses into my analysis to help group my data into subsets based on the following:
* `building_type`: apartment, house, and other were the only responses given
* `window_use`: responses included to get fresh air, change temperature, both, and none
* `smell`: there were quite a few options but smell should be linked to some aspect of air quality, right?
* `cleaner_use`: in light of COVID, we asked participants about what cleaner(s) (i.e. bleach, vinegar, soap and water, etc.) that they used

The summary of results includes:
* :red_square: `building_type` and sleep metrics
* :red_square: `smell`:`cooking` and `pm2p5_number`
* :green_square: `cleaner_use`:`alcohol` and `tvoc`
* :green_square: `window_use`:`fresh_air` and `co2`
* :green_square: `smell`:`well_ventilated` and `co2`
