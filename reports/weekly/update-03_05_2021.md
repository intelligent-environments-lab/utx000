# Weekly Update - March 5th 2021
This past week, I focused on:
1. Incorporating new Fitbit data into analysis/paper
2. Continuing to probe the relationship between variables and Fitbit sleep
3. Organizing SDHC trainings and trying to increase participation
4. Designing the GsAB recruitment space

## More Fitbit Data
I incorporated the Fitbit data from Cameron's ULG study. This helped provide:
* 4 additional participants
* 300+ additional nights of data
