# Ventilation Rate Analysis

## Ventilation Profiles

Question: How do I handle nights that have multiple ventilation rate calculations? Average them together? If I do that, how does that correspond to pollution profiles?

## Pollution Profiles and Ventilaion

Question: Should I look at the pollution profiles from the period I calculated the ventilation rate, the entire night, or both?
