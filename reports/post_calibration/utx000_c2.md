# UTX000 BEVO Beacon Post-Calibration - Cohort 2
This page documents the calibration process used to correct the BEVO Beacons used in the deployment of Cohort 2 of the UTX000 study. In addition, some of the remaining beacons are pre-calibrated as well for future deployments. 

## Calibration Equipment
The BEVO Beacons will be calibrated against four other, laboratory-grade instruments:

### Aerodyne Cavity Attenuated Phase Shift (CAPS) NO2 Monitor
<img src="https://github.com/intelligent-environments-lab/utx000/blob/master/reports/post_calibration/images/NO2_Monitor.JPG" alt="NO2 Monitor" align="right" height="200"/>

This monitor measures NO2 concentrations using "an optical absorption spectrometer, utilizing a blue LED as a light source, a sample cell incorporating two high reflectivity mirrors centered at 450 nm and a vacuum photodiode detector". Operating the instrument is done with the software provided after connecting the instrument to the laptop via USB cable. The manual can be found [here](https://github.com/intelligent-environments-lab/utx000/blob/master/references/lab_grade_instruments/NO2_Monitor_Manual.pdf).

#### Taking a Baseline
<img src="https://github.com/intelligent-environments-lab/utx000/blob/master/reports/post_calibration/images/t-valve.png" alt="t-valve" align="right" width="300"/>

The following procedures should be done **first** prior to any calibration events:
1. Power on the device and wait 10 minutes for the monitor to reach final operating temperature.
2. Connect NO2-free air to the inlet using a T-valve as shown in the diagram. For our purposes, we are using N2 gas and the swaglock cap must be unscrewed from the T-valve to allow for excess flow.
3. Using the flowmeter, ensure a flow rate of at least 2 L/min of NO2-free gas.
4. Find the **Take Baseline** command under the BASELINE window to start the procedure.
5. Run the baseline procedure for at least 10 minutes. 
6. Once completed, detach N2 feed from the inlet and screw swaglock cap back on.

After these steps, the device is ready for measurement.

#### Operating Procedure
The following steps were taken when operating the device:
1.

#### Data 
Data are logged automatically

### ECO PHYSICS nCLD 88 NO Monitor

A thorough description of the NO/NOx monitor can be found [here](https://www.ecophysics.com/environmental/modular-line/ncld-88/). 

#### Taking a Baseline
Similar to the NO2 monitor, this device should be baselined prior to use in any calibration event. The steps are alos similar, but described below:
1. Power on the device and wait _30_ minutes for the monitor to reach final operating temperature.
2. Connect NOx-free air to the inlet using a T-valve as shown in the diagram. For our purposes, we are using N2 gas and the swaglock cap must be unscrewed from the T-valve to allow for excess flow.
3. Using the flowmeter, ensure a flow rate of at least 2 L/min of NOx-free gas. 
4. Run the baseline procedure until a stable measurement is reached.
5. If the concentration of NO is far from zero, a calibration will have to be done which can be found in the monitors [quick guide](https://github.com/intelligent-environments-lab/utx000/blob/master/references/lab_grade_instruments/NO_Monitor_Manual.pdf). 
5. Once completed, detach N2 feed from the inlet and screw swaglock cap back on.

#### Operating Procedure
The following steps were taken when operating the device:
1. When the monitor starts up, the software will automatically be brought up.
2. Wait until the LED in the monitor turns green and the word "ready" is shown in the top left corner. 
3. Click the play button to run.
4. Click the stop button to end.

#### Data
To export the data:
1. Attach a USB drive to the back panel of the instrument
2. On the touchscreen on the front panel is a button on the right with a diagonal line on it. Press this button to show the menu.
3. From the menu, choose measurements > export > displayed measurements
4. From here, you can choose the measurement rate up to 1-second intervals
5. 

### Licor CO2 Monitor
<img src="https://github.com/intelligent-environments-lab/utx000/blob/master/reports/post_calibration/images/CO2_Monitor.jpg" alt="PM Monitor" align="right" height="200"/>

This instrument requires CO2-free gas to be run through the device.

#### Operating Procedure
The following steps are taken when operating the device:
1. Turn on monitor, open N2 canister valve, plug in flowmeter, and set flowrate on the flowmeter to 0.09 L/min
2. Wait for stable CO2 concentration.
3. Click the play arrow button to run.
4. Click the stop button to end - do **NOT** press the abort button at the top left of the screen

#### Data
Data can be easily written to a file saved anywhere on the supporting machine. 

### TSI Aerodynmaic Particle Sizer (APS) PM Monitor 
<img src="https://github.com/intelligent-environments-lab/utx000/blob/master/reports/post_calibration/images/PM_Monitor.jpg" alt="PM Monitor" align="right" height="200"/>

This instrument measures particles between sizes of 0.5 to 20 micrometers using time-of-flight aerodynamic sizing to determine a particle's behavior while airborne and is unaffected by index of refraction or Mie scattering.

#### Operating Procedure
The following steps are taken when operating the device:
1. Turn the monitor on and allow it to run for at least 20 minutes.
2. Using the dial on the instrument, make sure the pump is on (the instrument should be making noise). 
3. From the computer connected to the device, go to > properties to change the measurement interval and length. 
4. Hit the green arrow at the top left of the software window to start logging.
5. The instrument will stop logging when the time limit is reached.

#### Data
The data are saved to the instance of the APS file. The data must be selected and exported to a CSV file and there are multiple options. Make sure to choose:
1. Number and Concentration profiles
2. Orient by column for a more traditional output of the data

## Laboratory Setup
The UTesthouse was the facility use to post-calibrate the beacons. The image below shows a few different angles of the setup with text indicating various locations which are discribed in more detail below the figures.

### A
This location hosts the PM, NO, and NO2 monitors. The laptop used to control the PM, NO2, and CO2 monitors sets on top of the NO monitor. 

### B
Here we have just the CO2 monitor and the flow meter.

### C
The bulk of the BEVO Beacons are in location C. To the left of the stove are beacons that are being pre-calibrated after repairs have been made. To the right of the stove are beacons that were used in the UTX000 study. 

### D 
The remaining BEVO Beacons are here. Again these beacons were those used in the UTX000 study.

## Start-Up Procedure
This section outlines the general procedure to be followed when post-calibrating the BEVO Beacons. 

### Instruments On
When starting, all instruments should be turned on. This includes the laboratory grade instruments described above as well as the BEVO Beacons. Many of the instruments and beacon sensors require a brief warm-up period to operate effectively. During this time, one can set the baselines for the NO and NO2 monitors using the N2 feed from the CO2 monitor.

### Baselining
During the first 45 minutes, baselining procedure can take place:
1. Attach the N2 feed from the tank to the inlet of the NO2 monitor and remove the swaglock cap.
2. After 10 minutes, the NO2 monitor is ready for baselining. Open the N2 tank to allow the flow of gas to the monitor. 
3. Turn on the flow meter and set the flow rate to 2 L/min.
4. Start the baselining program and run for 20 minutes or until program is complete. 
5. NO monitor should be ready for baselining now.
6. Unplug flowmeter and close N2 tank.
7. Detach N2 tube from NO2 monitor and attach to the inlet of the NO monitor.
8. Unscrew swaglock cap from NO monitor.
9. Screw swaglock cap back on NO2 monitor. 
10. Run baselining until concentration on NO monitor steadies. 

### Instrument Pre-Checks
During the baselining, the following pre-checks should be made:
1. **BEVO Beacons are connected to WiFi**: Check the Logmein VPN Profile - the IP addresses might have to be updated. 
2. **Run BEVO Beacon diagnostics**: The ```diagnostics.py``` script found [here]() will pull all data from connected beacons, remove it from their local storage, and check if each sesnor is reporting values for the current day or over a specified range. Any beacon that does not pass diagnostics is immediately switched off. 
4. **Laboratory-grade instruments showing data**: Each of the lab-grade monitors should have some output of what they are measuring. Make sure each is reporting values.

## Data Collection
After all baselining and pre-checks are complete, the calibration data can be collected. The following considerations for each variable are below:

- **PM**: Need to span up to a miminum of 100 micrograms per cubic meter and/or 1000 particles per cubic centimeter for PM2.5 at least. The maximum range of concentrations on the SPS30 sensors are 1000 micrograms per cubic meter and 3000 particles per cubic centimeter (see [datasheet](https://www.sensirion.com/fileadmin/user_upload/customers/sensirion/Dokumente/9.6_Particulate_Matter/Datasheets/Sensirion_PM_Sensors_SPS30_Datasheet.pdf)). However, concentrations this high are highly unlikely
- **CO2**: Need to span up to a minimum of 3,000 ppm since this value represents an artificial ceiling on the measurements made during the UTX000 study. The accuracy seems to remain consistent up to 10,000 ppm (see [datasheet](https://www.sensirion.com/fileadmin/user_upload/customers/sensirion/Dokumente/9.5_CO2/Sensirion_CO2_Sensors_SCD30_Datasheet.pdf)), but concentrations this high are highly unlikely and shouldn't be calibrated for. 
- **NO2**: The NO2 sensors measures up to 5 ppm with a 20 ppb resolution (see [datasheet](https://www.spec-sensors.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/DGS-NO2-968-043_9-6-17.pdf)). However concentrations should never even reach the 0.5 ppm mark. Therefore, an NO2 concentration of at least 100 ppb should be enough to properly calibrate these sensors. Concentrations higher than this were encountered during the study, but that is most likely due to improper pre-calibration, rather than the actual concentration reached.
