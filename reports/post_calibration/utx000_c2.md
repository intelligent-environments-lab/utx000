# UTX000 BEVO Beacon Post-Calibration - Cohort 2
This page documents the calibration process used to correct the BEVO Beacons used in the deployment of Cohort 2 of the UTX000 study. In addition, some of the remaining beacons are pre-calibrated as well for future deployments. 

## Calibration Equipment
The BEVO Beacons will be calibrated against four other, laboratory-grade instruments:

### Aerodyne Cavity Attenuated Phase Shift (CAPS) NO2 Monitor
This monitor measures NO2 concentrations using "an optical absorption spectrometer, utilizing a blue LED as a light source, a sample cell incorporating two high reflectivity mirrors centered at 450 nm and a vacuum photodiode detector". Operating the instrument is done with the software provided after connecting the instrument to the laptop via USB cable. 

#### Taking a Baseline
The following procedures should be done **first** prior to any calibration events:
1. Power on the device and wait 10 minutes for the monitor to reach final operating temperature.
2. Connect NO2-free air to the inlet using a T-valve as shown in the diagram. For our purposes, we are using N2 gas and the swaglock cap must be unscrewed from the T-valve to allow for excess flow.
3. Using the flowmeter, ensure a flow rate of at least 2 L/min of NO2-free gas.
4. Find the **Take Baseline** command under the BASELINE window to start the procedure.
5. Run the baseline procedure for at least 10 minutes. 
6. Once completed, detach N2 feed from the inlet and screw swaglock cap back on.

After these steps, the device is ready for measurement.

#### Operating Procedure

### ECO PHYSICS nCLD 88
A thorough description of the NO/NOx monitor can be found [here](https://www.ecophysics.com/environmental/modular-line/ncld-88/). 

#### Taking a Baseline
Similar to the NO2 monitor, this device should be baselined prior to use in any calibration event. The steps are alos similar, but described below:
1. Power on the device and wait _30_ minutes for the monitor to reach final operating temperature.
2. Connect NOx-free air to the inlet using a T-valve as shown in the diagram. For our purposes, we are using N2 gas and the swaglock cap must be unscrewed from the T-valve to allow for excess flow.
3. Using the flowmeter, ensure a flow rate of at least 2 L/min of NOx-free gas. 
4. Run the baseline procedure until a stable measurement is reached.
5. If the concentration of NO is far from zero, a calibration will have to be done which can be found in the monitors [quick guide](). 
5. Once completed, detach N2 feed from the inlet and screw swaglock cap back on.

#### Operating Procedure
The following steps were taken when operating the device:
1. When the monitor starts up, the software will automatically be brought up.
2. Wait until the LED in the monitor turns green and the word "ready" is shown in the top left corner. 
3. Click the play button to run.
4. Click the stop button to end.

#### Data
To export the data:
1. Attach a USB drive to the back panel of the instrument
2. On the touchscreen on the front panel is a button on the right with a diagonal line on it. Press this button to show the menu.
3. From the menu, choose measurements > export > displayed measurements
4. From here, you can choose the measurement rate up to 1-second intervals
5. 

### Licor CO2 Monitor
This instrument requires CO2-free gas to be run through the device.

#### Operating Procedure
The following steps were taken when operating the device:
1. Turn on monitor, open N2 canister valve, plug in flowmeter, and set flowrate on the flowmeter to 0.09 L/min
2. Wait for stable CO2 concentration.
3. Click the play arrow button to run.
4. Click the stop button to end - do **NOT** press the abort button at the top left of the screen
