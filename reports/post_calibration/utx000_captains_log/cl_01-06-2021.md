## Fixing Beacons

### BB33
Beacon 33 seems to be working fine - going to leave it plugged in to monitor.

### BB35
Beacon 35 seems to have trouble connecting to the VPN, but connected after about 10 minutes. I updated/upgraded the software which seemed to help. 

### BB37
The SPS30 on Beacon 37 was not being registered so I swapped it with a new one, and the beacon seems to be working fine. Going to leave it plugged in to monitor.
