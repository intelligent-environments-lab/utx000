### BB05
Replaced the SPS30 and is now logging PM.

### BB08
Connected to the VPN! I ran a full diagonistics.

### BB09
Does not boot up - will have to diagnose further.

### BB13
Replaced the SPS30 and is now logging PM.

### BB22
Replaced the SPS30 and is now logging PM.

### BB27
Replaced the SCD30 and is now logging CO2.

### BB30
Replaced the SCD30 and is now logging CO2.

### BB31
Replaced the SCD30 and is now logging CO2, but the concentration is quite low. 

### BB43
Changed the WiFi and connected to VPN. All sensors seemed to be online and ran a full diagnostics. 

### BB44
Replaced the SPS30 and is now logging PM.

### BB46
Replaced the SPS30 and is now logging PM.
