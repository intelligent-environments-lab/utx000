Today I ran two shorter tests with more intermittent sources to get a better representative dataset.

## Summary
The following things were accomplished
- Determined time offset for monitors
- Calibration - co2 2 (1 hour)
- Calibration - PM 2 (1 hour)

## Monitor Time Offset
The computer used to run the monitors has the incorrect time and is off by nearly 5 minutes. I determined the offset by using the CO2 monitor and logged when I started a test versus what the monitor reported. 

## Calibration - CO2 2
I ran the second calibration event where I introduced CO2 from the cylinder.

**Event Name**: CO2 2 <br>
**Start Time**: 01-15-2021 9:35 CST <br>
**End Time**: 01-15-2021 10:35 CST <br>
**Monitors Used**: CO2 <br>
**Beacons Used (from study)**: 1, 5, 10, 13, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 28, 29, 30, 32, 34, 36, 38, 40, 44, 46, 48 <br>
**Beacons Used (from infirmary)**: 2, 4, 8 12, 14, 27, 31, 33, 35, 37, 43 <br>
**Notes**: Opened cylinder at 9:45 and closed it at 10:05. Reopened the cylinder at 10:15 and closed it at 10:25. 

## Calibration - CO2 2
I ran the second calibration event where I introduced CO2 from the cylinder.

**Event Name**: PM 2 <br>
**Start Time**: 01-15-2021 11:00 CST <br>
**End Time**: 01-15-2021 12:00 CST <br>
**Monitors Used**: PM <br>
**Beacons Used (from study)**: 1, 5, 10, 13, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 28, 29, 30, 32, 34, 36, 38, 40, 44, 46, 48 <br>
**Beacons Used (from infirmary)**: 2, 4, 8 12, 14, 27, 31, 33, 35, 37, 43 <br>
**Notes**: Lit a candle at 11:10 and extinguished it at 11:15.
