# Captain's Log - 12/30/2020
Today marked the second day of calibrating at the test house which incorporated the first event with a source: candle.

## Summary
The following things were accomplished
- Calibration - candle test 
- Calibration - background 3
- Fixing beacons in infirmary

## Calibration - Candle 1
I ran another background data collection event without introducing any outside sources since the first event had issues with the NO sensor and with downloading PM data. The details are below:

**Event Name**: Candle 1 <br>
**Start Time**: 10:20 CST <br>
**End Time**: 12:25 CST <br>
**Monitors Used**: NO2, CO2, PM <br>
**Beacons Used (from study)**: 1, 5, 10, 13, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 28, 29, 30, 32, 34, 36, 38, 40, 44, 46, 48 <br>
**Beacons Used (from infirmary)**: 4, 9, 12, 14, 27, 31 <br>
**Notes**: Lit a candle in the main room at 11:20 CST and extinguished it after the test was completed.

## Calibration - Background 3
I started another background data collection event that will last for a period of 24 hours to get a more extensive dataset. 

**Event Name**: Background 3 <br>
**Start Time**: 12-30-2020 12:40 CST <br>
**End Time**: 12-31-2020 12:40 CST <br>

**Beacons Used (from study)**: 1, 5, 10, 13, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 28, 29, 30, 32, 34, 36, 38, 40, 44, 46, 48 <br>

**Notes**:

## Fixing Beacons
I diagnosed and fixed more issues with the following beacons and here are some updates from older ones.

### BB2
Tried updating/grading but still the connectivity issues persist. 

### BB8
Software still needs updating.

**Needs**: New SD card

### BB9
Connectivity issues still persist - will need to reset software. 

### BB31
Connected to VPN and all the sensors are accounted for. Running off to the side in the latest calibration event. 

### BB48

**Missing**: TSL
