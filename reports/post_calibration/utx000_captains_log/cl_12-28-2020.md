# Captain's Log - 12/28/2020
Today marked the first day of calibrating at the test house which incorporated a lot of set up and learning of the lab-grade monitors. 

## Summary
The following things were accomplished
- Calibration - background
- Fixing beacons in infirmary

## Calibration - Background 2
I ran another background data collection event without introducing any outside sources since the first event had issues with the NO sensor and with downloading PM data. The details are below:

**Event Name**: Background 2 <br>
**Start Time**: 11:12 CST <br>
**End Time**: 12:22 CST <br>
**Monitors Used**: NO, NO2, CO2, PM <br>
**Beacons Used (from study)**: 5, 10, 13, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 28, 29, 30, 32, 34, 36, 40, 44, 46, 48 <br>
**Beacons Used (from infirmary)**: 4, 12
**Notes**: 

## Fixing Beacons
I diagnosed and fixed more issues with the following beacons and here are some updates from older ones.

### BB2
No updates - connectivity issues with vpn. 

### BB4
Ran over the holiday and seems to be working fine except for some of the log3 sensors. However, all the sensors that we are calibrating against work. Added to the latest calibration event. 

### BB8
The software seems to be outdated. Best ot copy over a clone of one of the working SD cards. 

**Needs**: New SD card

### BB9
Same issues as BB2 with connecting to VPN. Working to reinstall VPN software. Ran through the following processes:
1. Removed .deb file associated with logmein
2. Updated and upgraded software with: 
```$ sudo apt-get update```<br>
```$ sudo apt-get upgrade```

Somewhere in that process, the beacon came online. Will have to run for a prolonged period to see if it stays connected.

I also had to update the IPv4 address in ```/etc/hosts```.

### BB12
Needed to update wifi password but otherwise seems to be working fine. I added it to the latest calibration event.

### BB48

**Missing**: TSL
