# Captain's Log - 12/22/2020
Today marked the first day of calibrating at the test house which incorporated a lot of set up and learning of the lab-grade monitors. 

## Summary
The following things were accomplished
- NO baselining
- NO2 baselining
- Calibration - background
- Identification of troublesome beacons

## Baselining
I was able to quickly baseline both the NO and NO2 monitors. The NO2 has an actual baselining function that I was able to perform three times to get a stable baseline of ~0 ppb when connected to pure N2. 

The NO does not have a set baselining function, but I was able to use N2 gas for the inlet and the measurement stabilized to ~2 ppb. 

## Calibration - Background 1
I ran a preliminary data collection event without introducing any outside sources. The details are below:

**Event Name**: Background 1
**Start Time**: 10:20 CST
**End Time**: 11:20 CST
**Monitors Used**: NO2, CO2, PM
**Beacons Used**: 5,10,13,15,16,17,18,19,21,22,23,24,25,26,28,29,30,32,34,36,40,44,46,48
**Notes**: NO monitor logging was not started (whoops!). 

## Troublesome Beacons
The only beacon from the study that had to be taken offline was BB1 and I am currently diagnosing the issue. All the other beacons were performing handsomely, although not all of them have NO2 sensors.

Just a minor note is that BB48 did not have a light sensor connected, but that is not important for the calibration.
