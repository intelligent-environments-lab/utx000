# Captain's Log - 12/22/2020
Today marked the first day of calibrating at the test house which incorporated a lot of set up and learning of the lab-grade monitors. 

## Summary
The following things were accomplished
- NO baselining
- NO2 baselining
- Calibration - background
- Identification of troublesome beacons

## Baselining
I was able to quickly baseline both the NO and NO2 monitors. The NO2 has an actual baselining function that I was able to perform three times to get a stable baseline of ~0 ppb when connected to pure N2.
