Hagen Fritz is a PhD Candidate in the Building Energy and Environments Department with Civil Engineering at the University of Texas at Austin. Hagen is a graduate research assistant working with the Intelligent Environments Laboratory and Whole Communities, Whole Health â€“ a UT Grand Challenge. His research is oriented towards how the built environment affects outcomes of human health, more specifically the interaction between indoor air quality and sleep quality. 

# Session Title

Activity and Sleep Pattern Changes in Univeristy Students Before, at the Onset of, and During the COVID-19 pandemic. 

# Equity

The data used to draw conclusions is gathered from a population of young adults attending the University of Texas at Austin with varied backgrounds, races, and ethnicities. Results from this study should be applicable to all university-attending, young adults across Texas and the US. 

# Session Description

Objectives. The purpose of this analysis is to understand how the outbreak of COVID-19 affected metrics for activity and sleep for young adults using a subset of students from the University of Texas at Austin as the study population. 

Methods. Data collected spans two studies conducted by Whole Communities, Whole Health Students - a UT Grand Challenge. In the first study, 50 students were recruited starting early January, 2020 and enrolled in a 2 month study, ending right before the Spring Break holiday and outbreak of COVID-19 in Texas. The second cohort consisted of 70 students, including many from the first cohort, and was a similar, but longer study beginning in mid-May and lasting 3.5 months. Data from the first cohort represents the "pre-COVID" period, while the second cohort includes data from just after the outbreak of the pandemic in addition to data during which participants began to acclimate themselves to the city- and nation-wide mandates.

Instruments. In both studies, participants were provided wearable fitness trackers, completed daily surveys regarding their mood and sleep via their smartphone, and answered monthly, comprehensive surveys about their activity, habits, etc. emailed periodically during the study periods. Wearable fitness trackers include in-depth metrics of both activity and sleep including steps walked, intensity levels (metabolic equivalents), total sleep time, and sleep stages, to name a few. Daily surveys were asked twice a day: morning surveys asked four questions about sleep quality and five regarding mood while evening surveys only asked the same questions on participants' moods. The comprehensive surverys included questions regarding the frequency of various activities in addition to general questions about changes in sleep habits. 

Results. We are able to track patterns in sleep habits as well as in activity both within a certain modality and across the three modalities (wearables, daily surveys, and comprehensive surveys). We have participant crossover between the two cohorts, allowing us to both monitor trends in a certain individual in addition to on an aggregate-basis for periods prior to, at the onset of, and during the COVID-19 pandemic. Initial results indicate that participants tended to be more sedentary - less steps and activity logged and more time spent asleep - around the onset of the pandemic compared to before and during.

Conclusions. Activity and sleep patterns of young adults, represented by a subset of university students, was initially affected by the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic. However, activity and sleep patterns quickly recovered in the following months for these individuals as they began to acclimate to the changes associated with the global pandemic. 

# Learning Objectives

1. Identify typical activity and sleep patterns of university students
2. Compare the depth of information and measurements provided by different mobile sensing technologies
3. Using multiple mobile sensing technologies, examine how activity and sleep patterns of university students changed as a result of the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic
