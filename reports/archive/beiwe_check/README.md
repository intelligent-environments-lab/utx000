# Beiwe Check
During the UTx000 study, I wanted to keep track of participation so I created this directory to hold the reports.

These reports can be generated by:
1. Downloading the accelerometer and survey data from the Beiwe server into the proper data directory (I believe it is the interim directory).
2. Convert the accelerometer data to numeric values in Excel (never created this functionality in Python)
3. Run the report generator in src>reports>make_report.py
