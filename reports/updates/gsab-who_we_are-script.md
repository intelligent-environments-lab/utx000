# GSAB Script

The Graduate Student Advisory Board is a student-run committee composed of Masters and PhD students from each of the disciplines within the Civil, Architectural, and Environmental Engineering Department. The GSAB is dedicated to improving the graduate student experience specifically within the CAEE department by providing a support system based on peer-to-peer communication. The goals of the GSAB are to provide information regarding academic and research success, function as liasons between the student population and departmental staff, and provide opportunities so that students can feel more connected to the students, faculty, and staff of the CAEE department. 

## Departmental Liason

As a new or current student, you might not always know who to take your concerns to or feel comfortable doing it. As members of the GSAB, we can bring your comments, questions, and concerns directly to the faculty and staff of the CAEE department in an anonymous way. We communicate regularly with members of the CAEE faculty and staff, send representatives to faculty meetings, and have the knowledge and experience to get your concerns into the right hands.

## Communications

We on the GSAB want the graduate students in the CAEE department to have all the information they need to successfully and efficiently navigate their way through the graduate program of their choosing, and do so with as little stress as possible. We aim to provide relevant information on important CAEE-based and campus-wide events, graduate degree milestones, and student successes through our bi-weekly newsletter.

## Student Experiences - Academic

There are a lot of questions regarding your academic pathway related to the classes you take and the milestones you need to hit. Members of the GSAB can help clear up confusion through the research they have done in addition to personal experiences so that you can be sure you are on track to graduate on time. 

## Student Experiences - Social

Graduate student life is not just about your academics and research, but also meeting like-minded individuals who share a passion of learning and critical thinking. The GSAB provides opportunities for you to connect with CAEE students outside your discipline or research group, helping you further develop social and professional ties that will continue to strengthen after you graduate. 

## Conclusion

Our communication lines are always open so don't hesitate to get into contact with us about any matter, small or large. We on the GSAB want to make your graduate student experience within CAEE as enjoyable and stress-free as possible. We are here to help you on your quest for greater knowledge and provide the support so you can be successful.
