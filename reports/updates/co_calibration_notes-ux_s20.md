Interestingly, experiment 3 provides lower constant values for each device _except_ for Device 46, which was a bit of a "wildcard". The following sections illustrate the concentrations during each of these experiments.

### Comparison to 5L Canister Experiments

There were two experiments conducted with 6 Beacons in total in the 5L canister where pure nitrogen was pumped into the space to remove any other polluants.

#### Experiment 2

#### Comparison

The table below compares the values form the constant models for each of the three chamber experiments and the one 5L canister experiment for these 6 devices.

| Device | Chamber 1 | Chamber 2 | Chamber 3 | 5L Canister |
| ------ | --------- | --------- | --------- | ----------- |
| 1      | 1.066107  | 0.892493  | -1.7706   | -4          |
| 11     | -3.152707 | -3.5178   | -5.469547 | -7          |
| 15     | 2.335147  | 2.108233  | -1.097    | -2.5        |
| 16     | 4.19132   | 4.03448   | 1.7525    | -0.75       |
| 19     | -0.010517 | -0.006    | 0.012693  | -0          |
| 21     | 2.244667  | 2.306533  | -0.0098   | -1          |
