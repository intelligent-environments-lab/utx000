This file is meant to house a small table that highlights the issues surrounding data collection from the multiple modalities. In terms of data collection/availability the main components for each of the modalities are:

- **Beacon**: All sensors which include:
  - CO2
  - PM
  - CO
  - NO2
  - Light
- **Beiwe**: We separate Beiwe data from EMAs although both are hosted by the Beiwe application. The main variables of interest from the Beiwe data include:
  - GPS
- **EMA**: There are three main EMAs participants were required to take. The approximate number of EMAs that _should_ have been filled out are given in paranthesis:
  - Morning Survey (52)
  - Evening Survey (52)
  - Weekly Survey (13)
- **Fitbit**: There are multiple data streams from Fitbit, but all should be collecting the same amount of data over the collection period except for sleep which required the participants to wear the device to bed. 

The following labels help to summarize the data availability:
- **Full**: Denotes a nearly complete dataset for all major components of the data collection modality i.e. all sensors for
