# Data Dictionary - IAQ Beacon
The data dictionary is divided into two parts according to the two files generated by the beacon each day:
1. **Python 2 Dictionary**: The data labels in this dictionary correspond to the variables and data gathered with a Python 2 script, otherwise known as the "sensirion" data because only the sensirion sensors use Python 2.
2. **Python 3 Dictionary**: Similar to above, but these data are gathered with a Python 3 scripts, otherwise known as the "adafruit" data since most of these sensors are Adafruit brand. 

## Python 2 Dictionary
The table below outlines the specifics of each variable. Data are gathered at 1-minute intervals unless otherwise stated in the *Notes* column.
