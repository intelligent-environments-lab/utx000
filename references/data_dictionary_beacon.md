# Data Dictionary - IAQ Beacon
The data dictionary is divided into two parts according to the two files generated by the beacon each day:
1. **Python 2 Dictionary**: The data labels in this dictionary correspond to the variables and data gathered with a Python 2 script, otherwise known as the "sensirion" data because only the sensirion sensors use Python 2.
2. **Python 3 Dictionary**: Similar to above, but these data are gathered with a Python 3 scripts, otherwise known as the "adafruit" data since most of these sensors are Adafruit brand. 

## Python 3 Dictionary
The table below outlines the specifics of each variable. Data are gathered at 1-minute intervals unless otherwise stated in the *Notes* column. 

| Column Header | Variable Description | Unit | Example Value | Sensor | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| TVOC | total volatile organic compound concentration | ppb | 20.96 | SGP30 | |
| eCO2 | equivalent CO2 concentration based on TVOC | ppm | 417.48 | SGP30 | not scaled linearly with TVOC |
| Lux | light/brightness level | lux | 10.1184 | TSL2591 | |
| Visible | proportion of visible light | NA | 4.96 | TSL2591 | see [Adafruit documentation](https://www.adafruit.com/product/1980) |
| Infrared | proportion of infrared light | NA | 12.11 | TSL2591 | see [Adafruit documentation](https://www.adafruit.com/product/1980) |
| NO2 | nitrogen dioxide concentration | ppb | 554.04 | Spec DGS-NO2 | |
